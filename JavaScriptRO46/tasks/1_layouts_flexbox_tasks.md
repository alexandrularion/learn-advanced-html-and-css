## Task 1: Simple Flex Container
**Objective:** Create a container with three child elements using Flexbox.

- Create a container `<div>` with three child `<div>` elements.
- Apply `display: flex;` to the container.
- Use Flexbox properties to ensure the child elements are displayed in a row.

## Task 2: Centering Content Horizontally
**Objective:** Center a single element horizontally within a container.

- Create a container `<div>` with a single child `<div>`.
- Set the width of the child element to be less than the container.
- Use Flexbox properties to horizontally center the child element within the container.

## Task 3: Vertical Centering
**Objective:** Center an element vertically within a container.

- Create a container `<div>` with a single child `<div>`.
- Set the height of the container.
- Use Flexbox to center the child element vertically within the container.

## Task 4: Centering Content Both Horizontally and Vertically
**Objective:** Center an element both horizontally and vertically within a container.

- Create a container `<div>` with a single child `<div>`.
- Use Flexbox properties to center the child element in both dimensions within the container.

## Task 5: Creating Space Between Elements
**Objective:** Distribute space evenly between elements within a container.

- Create a container `<div>` with three child `<div>` elements.
- Use `justify-content: space-between;` to place the first child element at the start, the last one at the end, and the middle one evenly spaced between them.

## Task 6: Flex Direction - Column
**Objective:** Change the direction of the flex items from a row to a column.

- Create a container `<div>` with three child `<div>` elements.
- Use `flex-direction: column;` to stack the child elements vertically.

## Task 7: Wrapping Flex Items
**Objective:** Allow flex items to wrap onto multiple lines within a container.

- Create a container `<div>` with multiple child `<div>` elements (e.g., six).
- Set a fixed width for the child elements.
- Use `flex-wrap: wrap;` to allow the items to wrap onto multiple lines if the container’s width is too small to fit them in a single row.

## Task 8: Aligning Items Along Cross Axis
**Objective:** Align items along the cross axis using `align-items`.

- Create a container `<div>` with three child `<div>` elements of different heights.
- Use `align-items: center;` to align the child elements along the center of the container’s cross axis (vertically, in a row layout).

## Task 9: Flexbox Order
**Objective:** Change the order of elements using the `order` property.

- Create a container `<div>` with four child `<div>` elements.
- Assign different `order` values to the child elements to rearrange them without changing the HTML structure.

## Task 10: Flex Grow and Shrink
**Objective:** Use `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` to control the size of flex items.

- Create a container `<div>` with three child `<div>` elements.
- Set different `flex-grow` values to make one child element take up more space than the others.
- Adjust the `flex-shrink` property to ensure that certain elements shrink more than others when the container’s size is reduced.
